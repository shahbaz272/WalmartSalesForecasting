# Walmart Sales Forecasting
***4th position on Kaggle***

### Problem

The aim of this project is to predict the weekly department-wise sales of 45 Walmart stores in the US using historical data

The ability to forecast sales for any business is of crucial importance. With an insight on what the expected sales would be in the near future the businesses can plan accordingly. The managers are able to schedule shifts, allocate resources, stock inventory etc based on the forecast. 

The dataset is taken from Kaggle from a competition hosted by Walmart.

### Client

A lot of businesses have a somewhat homogenous sales trend over time except for in the Holiday seasons. Being able to accurately predict the sales in the Holiday seasons is even more important. The challenge in predicting Holiday sales is that there isn't much data available. This problem can be applied to any industry/business whose sales are affected by the holiday seasons. They can use this information to manage resources, complete inventory, launch applicable promotions etc.

### Dataset

The data that I will be using is of 45 Walmart stores. The dataset can be easily downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/walmart-recruiting-store-sales-forecasting/data). It contains department wise weekly sales for each store for over 2 years, along with 12 features.
